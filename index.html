                <h2>The Frog Prince</h2>
                <img src="frog.jpg" alt="">
                <p>One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself
                    in
                    a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water with a rose in the middle of it, she sat herself
                    down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favorites plaything; and
                    she
                    was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell.</p>
                <p> After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded
                    away,
                    and rolled along on the ground, until at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into
                    the
                    spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. She
                    began
                    to cry, and said, 'Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and
                    jewels,
                    and everything that I have in the world.'

                    Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, 'Princess, why do you weep
                    so
                    bitterly?'

                    'Alas!' said she, 'what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the
                    spring.'

                    The frog said, 'I do not want your pearls</p>
